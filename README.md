Server rating mod for Minetest!

This mod adds 2 chatcommands that will allow you to rate and read ratings and reviews that a server has.  All ratings and reviews are saved to a database file in the world folder.  It may be possible to use the results gathered in that file to make an online server rating website.

# Chatcommands:
 - /rate <number value between 0 and 5> <Description>
 - /rating
 
 An example of /rate would be "/rate 4.5 I really like this server.  However, it could use some work."
 /rating lets you view the server rating formspec.  Here you can see the overall rating and each individual review.
